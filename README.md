# Uroboros
Everscale Blockchain Killer

## Disclamer
No warranty, no support, no evil intent. Use at your own risk. You have been warned.

## Usage: 
1. Compute Uroboros address (use random nonce variable to deploy multiple Uroboroses using one owner)
2. Send 400+ EVER to the address
3. Deploy contract
4. Call "orderToEat" with optional message that will be seen on blockchain. 

Uroboros will start eating its tail, sending messages to self.

## Compilation/Deploy scripts
Do you really want to kill Everscale with just one button press? Please do some work, compile and deploy this contract yourself, show some respect to the community :)
